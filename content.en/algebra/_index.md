==Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia== was an ==Italian mathematician==engineer, surveyor and bookkeeper from then Republic of Venice (now Italy). He published many books, including the first Italian translations of Archimedes and Euclid, and an acclaimed compilation of mathematics. Tartaglia was the first to apply mathematics to the investigation of the paths of cannonballs; his work was later validated by Galileo’s studies on falling bodies. 

Tartaglia along with Cardano were credited for finding methods to solve any ==third degree polynomials== called ==cubic equations==. He also provided a nice formula for calculating volume of any tetrahedron using distance between pairs of its four vertices.

## Introduction

Algebra can be thought of as the next level of study of numbers. If we need to determine anything subject to certain specific conditions, then we need Algebra. In that sense, the study of Algebra is considered as “Science of determining unknowns”. During third century AD(CE) Diophantus of Alexandria wrote a monumental book titled “Arithmetica” in thirteen volumes of which only six has survived. This book is the first source where the conditions of the problems are stated as equations and they are eventually solved. Diophantus realized that for many real life situation problems, the variables considered are usually positive integers. 

The term “Algebra” has evolved as a misspelling of the word ‘al-jabr’ from one of the important work titled Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaşar fī hisāb al-jabr wa’l-muqābala (“The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing”) written by Persian Mathematician ==Al-Khwarizmi== of 9th Century AD(CE) Since Al-Khwarizmi’s Al-Jabr book provided the most appropriate methods of solving equations, he is hailed a“ ==Father of Algebra==”. 

In the earlier classes, we had studied several important concepts in Algebra. In this class, we will continue our journey to understand other important concepts which will be of much help in solving problems of greater scope. Real understanding of these ideas will benefit much in learning higher mathematics in future classes.
