## 5.4 Inclination of a Line

The **inclination** of a line or the **angle of inclination** of a line is the angle which a straight line makes with the positive direction of X-axis measured in the counter-clockwise direction to the part of the line above the X-axis. The inclination of the line is usually denoted by $\theta$.

> **Note:**
> - The inclination of X-axis and every line parallel to X-axis is $0°$.
> - The inclination of Y-axis and every line parallel to Y-axis is $90°$.

### 5.4.1 Slope of a Straight line

While laying roads one must know how steep the road will be. Similarly, when constructing a staircase, we should consider its steepness. For the same reason, anyone travelling along a hill or a bridge, feels hard compared to travelling along a plain road.

All these examples illustrate one important aspect called **"Steepness"**. The measure of steepness is called **slope** or **gradient**.

The concept of slope is important in economics because it is used to measure the rate at which the demand for a product changes in a given period of time on the basis of its price. Slope comprises of two factors namely steepness and direction.

#### Definition

If $\theta$ is the angle of inclination of a non-vertical straight line, then $\tan\theta$ is called the **slope** or **gradient** of the line and is denoted by $m$.

Therefore the slope of the straight line is:

$$m = \tan\theta, \quad 0° \leq \theta \leq 180°, \quad \theta \neq 90°$$

#### To find the slope of a straight line when two points are given

$$\text{Slope } m = \tan\theta = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{adjacent side}} = \frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

$$\text{Slope } m = \frac{\text{Difference in y coordinates}}{\text{Difference in x coordinates}}$$

> **Note:**
> - The slope of a vertical line is **undefined**.
> - The slope of the line through $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ with $x_1 \neq x_2$ is $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.

#### Values of slopes

| S.No. | Condition | Slope | Diagram |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------|
| (i) | $\theta = 0°$ | $m = 0$ | The line is parallel to the positive direction of X axis. |
| (ii) | $0° < \theta < 90°$ | $m > 0$ (positive) | The line has positive slope (A line with positive slope rises from left to right). |
| (iii) | $90° < \theta < 180°$ | $m < 0$ (negative) | The line has negative slope (A line with negative slope falls from left to right). |
| (iv) | $\theta = 180°$ | $m = 0$ | The line is parallel to the negative direction of X axis. |
| (v) | $\theta = 90°$ | undefined | The slope is undefined. |

## 5.4.2 Slopes of parallel lines

Two non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.

Let $l_1$ and $l_2$ be two non-vertical lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively.

Let the inclination of the lines with positive direction of X axis be $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ respectively.

Assume, $l_1$ and $l_2$ are parallel.

$$\theta_1 = \theta_2 \text{ (Since, } \theta_1, \theta_2 \text{ are corresponding angles)}$$

$$\tan\theta_1 = \tan\theta_2$$

$$m_1 = m_2$$

Hence, the slopes are equal. Therefore, non-vertical parallel lines have equal slopes.

### Conversely

Let the slopes be equal, then $m_1 = m_2$

$$\tan\theta_1 = \tan\theta_2$$

$$\theta_1 = \theta_2 \text{ (since } 0° \leq \theta_1, \theta_2 \leq 180°)$$

That is the corresponding angles are equal.

Therefore, $l_1$ and $l_2$ are parallel.

Thus, non-vertical lines having equal slopes are parallel.

**Hence, non vertical lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.**

## 5.4.3 Slopes of perpendicular lines

Two non-vertical lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ are perpendicular if and only if $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$.

Let $l_1$ and $l_2$ be two non-vertical lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively. Let their inclinations be $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ respectively.

Then $m_1 = \tan\theta_1$ and $m_2 = \tan\theta_2$

First we assume that, $l_1$ and $l_2$ are perpendicular to each other.

Then $\angle ABC = 90° - \theta_1$ (sum of angles of $\triangle ABC$ is $180°$)

Now measuring slope of $l_2$ through angles $\theta_2$ and $90° - \theta_1$, which are opposite to each other, we get:

$$\tan\theta_2 = -\tan(90° - \theta_1) = -\frac{\sin(90° - \theta_1)}{\cos(90° - \theta_1)} = -\frac{\cos\theta_1}{\sin\theta_1} = -\cot\theta_1$$

$$\tan\theta_2 = -\frac{1}{\tan\theta_1}$$

$$\tan\theta_1 \cdot \tan\theta_2 = -1$$

Thus, when the line $l_1$ is perpendicular to line $l_2$ then $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$.

### Conversely

Let $l_1$ and $l_2$ be two non-vertical lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively, such that $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$.

Since $m_1 = \tan\theta_1$, $m_2 = \tan\theta_2$

We have $\tan\theta_1 \cdot \tan\theta_2 = -1$

$$\tan\theta_2 = -\frac{1}{\tan\theta_1} = -\cot\theta_1 = \tan(90° + \theta_1)$$

$$\theta_2 = 90° + \theta_1$$

But in $\triangle ABC$, $\theta_2 = \angle C + \theta_1$

Therefore, $\angle C = 90°$

> **Note:** In any triangle, exterior angle is equal to sum of the interior opposite angles.

> **KNOW?** Let $l_1$ and $l_2$ be two lines with well-defined slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively, then:
> - (i) $l_1$ is parallel to $l_2$ if and only if $m_1 = m_2$.
> - (ii) $l_1$ is perpendicular to $l_2$ if and only if $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$.

### Example 5.8

(i) What is the slope of a line whose inclination is $30°$?
(ii) What is the inclination of a line whose slope is $\sqrt{3}$?

**Solution:**

(i) Here $\theta = 30°$

Slope $m = \tan\theta$

Therefore, slope $m = \tan 30° = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.

(ii) Given $m = \sqrt{3}$, let $\theta$ be the inclination of the line

$$\tan\theta = \sqrt{3}$$

We get, $\theta = 60°$

### Example 5.9

Find the slope of a line joining the given points

(i) $(-6,1)$ and $(-3,2)$
(ii) $\left(-\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ and $\left(\frac{2}{7}, \frac{3}{7}\right)$
(iii) $(14,10)$ and $(14,-6)$

**Solution:**

(i) $(-6,1)$ and $(-3,2)$

The slope $= \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{2-1}{-3+6} = \frac{1}{3}$

(ii) $\left(-\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}\right)$ and $\left(\frac{2}{7}, \frac{3}{7}\right)$

The slope $= \frac{\frac{3}{7} - \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{2}{7} + \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\frac{6-7}{14}}{\frac{6+7}{21}} = -\frac{1}{14} \times \frac{21}{13} = -\frac{3}{26}$

(iii) $(14,10)$ and $(14,-6)$

The slope $= \frac{-6-10}{14-14} = \frac{-16}{0}$

The slope is **undefined**.

### Example 5.10

The line $r$ passes through the points $(-2,2)$ and $(5,8)$ and the line $s$ passes through the points $(-8,7)$ and $(-2,0)$. Is the line $r$ perpendicular to $s$?

**Solution:**

The slope of line $r$ is $m_1 = \frac{8-2}{5+2} = \frac{6}{7}$

The slope of line $s$ is $m_2 = \frac{0-7}{-2+8} = \frac{-7}{6}$

The product of slopes $= \frac{6}{7} \times \frac{-7}{6} = -1$

That is, $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$

Therefore, the line $r$ is perpendicular to line $s$.

---

### Example 5.11

The line $p$ passes through the points $(3,-2)$, $(12,4)$ and the line $q$ passes through the points $(6,-2)$ and $(12,2)$. Is $p$ parallel to $q$?

**Solution:**

The slope of line $p$ is $m_1 = \frac{4+2}{12-3} = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$

The slope of line $q$ is $m_2 = \frac{2+2}{12-6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$

Thus, slope of line $p$ = slope of line $q$.

Therefore, line $p$ is parallel to the line $q$.

### Example 5.12

Show that the points $(-2,5)$, $(6,-1)$ and $(2,2)$ are collinear.

**Solution:** The vertices are $A(-2,5)$, $B(6,-1)$ and $C(2,2)$.

Slope of $AB = \frac{-1-5}{6+2} = \frac{-6}{8} = -\frac{3}{4}$

Slope of $BC = \frac{2+1}{2-6} = \frac{3}{-4} = -\frac{3}{4}$

We get, Slope of $AB$ = Slope of $BC$

Therefore, the points $A, B, C$ all lie in a same straight line.

Hence the points $A, B$ and $C$ are collinear.

### Example 5.13

Let $A(1,-2)$, $B(6,-2)$, $C(5,1)$ and $D(2,1)$ be four points

(i) Find the slope of the line segments (a) $AB$ (b) $CD$
(ii) Find the slope of the line segments (a) $BC$ (b) $AD$
(iii) What can you deduce from your answer.

**Solution:**

(i) (a) Slope of $AB = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-2+2}{6-1} = 0$

(b) Slope of $CD = \frac{1-1}{2-5} = \frac{0}{-3} = 0$

(ii) (a) Slope of $BC = \frac{1+2}{5-6} = \frac{3}{-1} = -3$

(b) Slope of $AD = \frac{1+2}{2-1} = \frac{3}{1} = 3$

(iii) The slope of $AB$ and $CD$ are equal so $AB, CD$ are parallel.

Similarly the lines $AD$ and $BC$ are not parallel, since their slopes are not equal. So, we can deduce that the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a **trapezium**.

> If the slopes of both the pairs of opposite sides are equal then the quadrilateral is a **parallelogram**.

### Example 5.14

Consider the graph representing growth of population (in crores). Find the slope of the line $AB$ and hence estimate the population in the year 2030?

**Solution:** The points $A(2005, 96)$ and $B(2015, 100)$ are on the line $AB$.

$$\text{Slope of } AB = \frac{100-96}{2015-2005} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}$$

Let the growth of population in 2030 be $k$ crores.

Assuming that the point $C(2030, k)$ is on $AB$,

we have, slope of $AC$ = slope of $AB$

$$\frac{k-96}{2030-2005} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ gives } \frac{k-96}{25} = \frac{2}{5}$$

$$k - 96 = 10$$

$$k = 106$$

Hence the estimated population in 2030 = **106 Crores**.

### Example 5.15

Without using Pythagoras theorem, show that the points $(1,-4)$, $(2,-3)$ and $(4,-7)$ form a right angled triangle.

**Solution:** Let the given points be $A(1,-4)$, $B(2,-3)$ and $C(4,-7)$.

$$\text{The slope of } AB = \frac{-3+4}{2-1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$$

$$\text{The slope of } AC = \frac{-7+4}{4-1} = \frac{-3}{3} = -1$$

$$\text{Slope of } AB \times \text{slope of } AC = (1)(-1) = -1$$

$AB$ is perpendicular to $AC$. $\angle A = 90°$

Therefore, $\triangle ABC$ is a right angled triangle.

## Thinking Corner

Provide three examples of using the concept of slope in real-life situations.

### Example 5.16

Prove analytically that the line segment joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and is equal to half of its length.

**Solution:** Let $P(a,b)$, $Q(c,d)$ and $R(e,f)$ be the vertices of a triangle.

Let $S$ be the mid-point of $PQ$ and $T$ be the mid-point of $PR$.

Therefore,

$$S = \left(\frac{a+c}{2}, \frac{b+d}{2}\right) \text{ and } T = \left(\frac{a+e}{2}, \frac{b+f}{2}\right)$$

$$\text{Slope of } ST = \frac{\frac{b+f}{2} - \frac{b+d}{2}}{\frac{a+e}{2} - \frac{a+c}{2}} = \frac{f-d}{e-c}$$

And slope of $QR = \frac{f-d}{e-c}$

Therefore, $ST$ is parallel to $QR$. (since, their slopes are equal)

Also,

$$ST = \sqrt{\left(\frac{a+e}{2} - \frac{a+c}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b+f}{2} - \frac{b+d}{2}\right)^2}$$

$$= \sqrt{\frac{(e-c)^2}{4} + \frac{(f-d)^2}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(e-c)^2 + (f-d)^2} = \frac{1}{2}QR$$

Thus $ST$ is parallel to $QR$ and half of it.

> **Note:** This example illustrates how a geometrical result can be proved using coordinate Geometry.
