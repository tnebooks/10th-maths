# Mensuration

&gt; "Nature is an infinite sphere of which the centre is everywhere and the circumference nowhere" - Blaise Pascal

## Introduction
The ancient cultures throughout the world sought the idea of measurements for satisfying their daily needs. For example, they had to know how much area of crops needed to be grown in a given region; how much could a container hold? etc. These questions were very important for making decisions in agriculture and trade. They needed efficient and compact way of doing this. It is for this reason, mathematicians thought of applying geometry to real life situations to attain useful results. This was the reason for the origin of mensuration.

## Learning Outcomes
- To determine the surface area and volume of cylinder, cone, sphere, hemisphere and frustum.
- To compute volume and surface area of combined solids.
- To solve problems involving conversion of solids from one shape to another with no change in volume.

## Points to Remember

| Solid | Curved Surface Area / Lateral Surface Area | Total Surface Area | Volume |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Cuboid | 2h(l + b) | 2(lb + bh + lh) | l × b × h |
| Cube | 4a² | 6a² | a³ |
| Right Circular Cylinder | 2πrh | 2πr(h + r) | πr²h |
| Right Circular Cone | πrl (l = √(r² + h²)) | πr(l + r) | (1/3)πr²h |
| Sphere | 4πr² | 4πr² | (4/3)πr³ |
| Hemisphere | 2πr² | 3πr² | (2/3)πr³ |
| Hollow Cylinder | 2π(R + r)h | 2π(R + r)(R - r + h) | π(R² - r²)h |
| Hollow Sphere | 4πR² (outer surface area) | 4π(R² + r²) | (4/3)π(R³ - r³) |
| Hollow Hemisphere | 2π(R² + r²) | π(3R² + r²) | (2/3)π(R³ - r³) |
| Frustum of Right Circular Cone | π(R + r)l where l = √(h² + (R - r)²) | π(R + r)l + πR² + πr² | (1/3)πh[R² + r² + Rr] |
