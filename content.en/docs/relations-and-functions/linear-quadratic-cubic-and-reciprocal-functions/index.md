## 1.10.1 Linear Function

A function f: ℝ → ℝ defined by **f(x) = mx + c, m ≠ 0** is called a **linear function**. Geometrically this represents a straight line in the graph.

Some Specific Linear Functions and their graphs:

| No. | Function | Domain and Definition | Graph |
|-----|----------|----------------------|------|
| 1 | The identity function | f: ℝ → ℝ defined by f(x) = x |![](image-47.png) |
| 2 | Additive inverse function | f: ℝ → ℝ defined by f(x) = -x |![](image-48.png) |

## 1.10.2 Modulus or Absolute valued Function

f: [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) defined by:

f(x) = |x| = { x;   x ≥ 0
             { -x;  x < 0

---

### Note

- Modulus function is **not a linear function** but it is composed of two linear functions x and –x.
- Linear functions are always **one-one functions** and has applications in Cryptography as well as in several branches of Science and Technology.

## Points to Remember

- The Cartesian Product of A with B is defined as **A × B = {(a, b) | for all a ∈ A, b ∈ B}**
- A relation R from A to B is always a subset of A × B. That is **R ⊆ A × B**
- A relation R from X to Y is a function if for every x ∈ X there exists only one y ∈ Y.
- A function can be represented by:
  - (i) an arrow diagram
  - (ii) a tabular form
  - (iii) a set of ordered pairs
  - (iv) a graphical form

- Some types of functions:
  - (i) One-one function
  - (ii) Onto function
  - (iii) Many-one function
  - (iv) Into function

- **Identity function:** f(x) = x
- **Reciprocal function:** f(x) = 1/x
- **Constant function:** f(x) = c
- **Linear function:** f(x) = ax + b, a ≠ 0
- **Quadratic function:** f(x) = ax² + bx + c, a ≠ 0
- **Cubic function:** f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, a ≠ 0

- For three non-empty sets A, B and C, if f: A → B and g: B → C are two functions, then the composition of f and g is a function g∘f: A → C will be defined as **g∘f(x) = g(f(x))** for all x ∈ A.

- If f and g are any two functions, then in general, **f∘g ≠ g∘f**
- If f, g and h are any three functions, then **f∘(g∘h) = (f∘g)∘h**
