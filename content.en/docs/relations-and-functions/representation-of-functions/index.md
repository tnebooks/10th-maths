## 1.6 Representation of Functions

A function may be represented by:
- (a) a set of ordered pairs
- (b) a table form
- (c) an arrow diagram
- (d) a graphical form

Let f: A → B be a function

**(a) Set of ordered pairs**

The set f = {(x, y) | y = f(x), x ∈ A} of all ordered pairs represent a function.

**(b) Table form**

The values of x and the values of their respective images under f can be given in the form of a table.

**(c) Arrow diagram**

An arrow diagram indicates the elements of the domain of f and their respective images by means of arrows.

**(d) Graph**

The ordered pairs in the collection f = {(x, y) | y = f(x), x ∈ A} are plotted as points in the XY-plane. The graph of f is the totality of all such points.

Every function can be represented by a curve in a graph. But not every curve drawn in a graph will represent a function.

The following test will help us in determining whether a given curve is a function or not.

## 1.6.1 Vertical line test

A curve drawn in a graph represents a function, **if every vertical line intersects the curve at only one point**.

---

### Example 1.10

Using vertical line test, determine which of the following curves (Fig. 1.18(a), 1.18(b), 1.18(c), 1.18(d)) represent a function?

**Solution**

The curves in **Fig. 1.18(a)** and **Fig. 1.18(c)** do **not** represent a function as the vertical lines meet the curves in two points P and Q.

The curves in **Fig. 1.18(b)** and **Fig. 1.18(d)** **do** represent a function as the vertical lines meet the curve in at most one point.

### Note

Any equation represented in a graph is usually called a curve.

### Example 1.11

Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 5, 8, 11, 14} be two sets. Let f: A → B be a function given by f(x) = 3x - 1. Represent this function:
- (i) by arrow diagram
- (ii) in a table form
- (iii) as a set of ordered pairs
- (iv) in a graphical form

**Solution**

A = {1, 2, 3, 4}; B = {2, 5, 8, 11, 14}; f(x) = 3x - 1

- f(1) = 3(1) - 1 = 2
- f(2) = 3(2) - 1 = 5
- f(3) = 3(3) - 1 = 8
- f(4) = 3(4) - 1 = 11

**(i) Arrow diagram** - See Fig. 1.19

**(ii) Table form**

| x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| f(x) | 2 | 5 | 8 | 11 |

**(iii) Set of ordered pairs**

**f = {(1, 2), (2, 5), (3, 8), (4, 11)}**

**(iv) Graphical form**

In the XY-plane the points (1,2), (2,5), (3,8), (4,11) are plotted (Fig. 1.20).
