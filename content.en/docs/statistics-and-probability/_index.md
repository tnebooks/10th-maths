**Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis**, born at Kolkata, was an Indian statistician who devised a measure of comparison between two data sets. He introduced innovative techniques for conducting large-scale sample surveys and calculated acreages and crop yields by using the method of random sampling. For his pioneering work, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, one of India's highest honours, by the Indian government in 1968 and he is hailed as "Father of Indian Statistics". The Government of India has designated 29th June every year, coinciding with his birth anniversary, as "National Statistics Day".
