## 6.3 Heights and Distances

In this section, we will see how trigonometry is used for finding the heights and distances of various objects without actually measuring them. For example, the height of a tower, mountain, building or tree, distance of a ship from a light house, width of a river, etc. can be determined by using knowledge of trigonometry.

The process of finding Heights and Distances is the best example of applying trigonometry in real-life situations. We would explain these applications through some examples.

Before studying methods to find heights and distances, we should understand some basic definitions.

### Line of Sight

The line of sight is the line drawn from the eye of an observer to the point in the object viewed by the observer.

![](fig.6.5.png)

**Fig. 6.5**

### Theodolite

Theodolite is an instrument which is used in measuring the angle between an object and the eye of the observer. A theodolite consists of two graduated wheels placed at right angles to each other and a telescope. The wheels are used for the measurement of horizontal and vertical angles. The angle to the desired point is measured by positioning the telescope towards that point. The angle can be read on the telescope scale.

![](fig.6.6.png)

**Fig. 6.6**

### Angle of Elevation

The angle of elevation is an angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point being viewed is above the horizontal level. That is, the case when we raise our head to look at the object.

![](fig.6.7.png)

**Fig. 6.7**

### Angle of Depression

The angle of depression is an angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point is below the horizontal level. That is, the case when we lower our head to look at the point being viewed.

![](fig.6.8.png)

**Fig. 6.8**

### Clinometer

The angle of elevation and depression are usually measured by a device called clinometer.

&gt; **Note:**
&gt; - From a given point, when height of an object increases the angle of elevation increases. If h₁ &gt; h₂ then α &gt; β
&gt; - The angle of elevation increases as we move towards the foot of the vertical object like tower or building.

### Activity 2

Representation of situations through right triangles. Draw a figure to illustrate the situation.

| Situations | Draw a figure |
|:---|:---|
| A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground, which is 20m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is found to be 45°. | ![](fig.6.11.png) **Fig. 6.11** |
| An observer of 1.8 m tall is 25.2 m away from a chimney. The angle of elevation of the top of the chimney from her eyes is 45°. | |
| From a point P on the ground the angle of elevation of the top of a 20 m tall building is 30°. A flag is hoisted at the top of the building and the angle of elevation of the top of the flagstaff from P is 55°. | |
| The shadow of a tower standing on a level ground is found to be 40 m longer when the Sun's altitude is 30° than when it is 60°. | |

## 6.3.1 Problems involving Angle of Elevation

In this section, we try to solve problems when Angle of elevation are given.

### Example 6.18

Calculate ∠BAC in the given triangles. (tan 38.7° = 0.8011, tan 69.4° = 2.6604)

![](fig.6.12(a).png)

**Fig. 6.12(a)**

![](fig.6.12(b).png)

**Fig. 6.12(b)**

**Solution:**

(i) In the right angled ΔABC [see Fig. 6.12(a)]

tan θ = opposite side/adjacent side = 4/5 = 0.8

∴ θ = 38.7° (tan 38.7° = 0.8011)

∠BAC = 38.7°

(ii) In the right angled ΔABC [see Fig. 6.12(b)]

tan θ = 8/3 = 2.66...

∴ θ = 69.4° (tan 69.4° = 2.6604)

∠BAC = 69.4°

### Example 6.19

A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground, which is 48m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is 30°. Find the height of the tower.

![](fig.6.13.png)

**Fig. 6.13**

**Solution:**

Let PQ be the height of the tower.

Take PQ = h and QR is the distance between the tower and the point R.

In the right angled ΔPQR, ∠PRQ = 30°

tan θ = PQ/QR

tan 30° = h/48

1/√3 = h/48

h = 48/√3 = 16√3

Therefore, the height of the tower is 16√3 m.

### Example 6.20

A kite is flying at a height of 75m above the ground. The string attached to the kite is temporarily tied to a point on the ground. The inclination of the string with the ground is 60°. Find the length of the string, assuming that there is no slack in the string.

![](fig.6.14.png)

**Fig. 6.14**

**Solution:**

Let AB be the height of the kite above the ground. Then, AB = 75.

Let AC be the length of the string.

In the right angled ΔABC, ∠ACB = 60°

sin θ = AB/AC

sin 60° = 75/AC

√3/2 = 75/AC

AC = 150/√3 = 50√3

Hence, the length of the string is 50√3 m.

### Example 6.21

Two ships are sailing in the sea on either sides of a lighthouse. The angle of elevation of the top of the lighthouse as observed from the ships are 30° and 45° respectively. If the lighthouse is 200m high, find the distance between the two ships. (√3 = 1.732)

![](fig.6.15.png)

**Fig. 6.15**

**Solution:**

Let AB be the lighthouse. Let C and D be the positions of the two ships.

Then, AB = 200m.

∠ACB = 30°, ∠ADB = 45°

In the right angled ΔBAC, tan 30° = AB/AC

1/√3 = 200/AC ⇒ AC = 200√3 ... (1)

In the right angled ΔBAD, tan 45° = AB/AD

1 = 200/AD ⇒ AD = 200 ... (2)

Now, CD = AC + AD = 200√3 + 200 [by (1) and (2)]

CD = 200(√3 + 1) = 200 × 2.732 = 546.4

Distance between two ships is 546.4 m.

### Example 6.22

From a point on the ground, the angles of elevation of the bottom and top of a tower fixed at the top of a 30m high building are 45° and 60° respectively. Find the height of the tower. (√3 = 1.732)

![](fig.6.16.png)

**Fig. 6.16**

**Solution:**

Let AC be the height of the tower.

Let AB be the height of the building.

Then, AC = h metres, AB = 30m

In the right angled ΔCBP, ∠CPB = 60°

tan θ = BC/BP

tan 60° = (AB + AC)/BP

√3 = (30 + h)/BP ... (1)

In the right angled ΔABP, ∠APB = 45°

tan θ = AB/BP

tan 45° = 30/BP

BP = 30 ... (2)

Substituting (2) in (1), we get

√3 = (30 + h)/30

30√3 = 30 + h

h = 30(√3 − 1) = 30(1.732 − 1) = 30(0.732) = 21.96

Hence, the height of the tower is 21.96 m.

### Example 6.23

A TV tower stands vertically on a bank of a canal. The tower is watched from a point on the other bank directly opposite to it. The angle of elevation of the top of the tower is 58°. From another point 20m away from this point on the line joining this point to the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is 30°. Find the height of the tower and the width of the canal. (tan 58° = 1.6003)

![](fig.6.17.png)

**Fig. 6.17**

**Solution:**

Let AB be the height of the TV tower.

CD = 20m.

Let BC be the width of the canal.

In the right angled ΔABC, tan 58° = AB/BC

1.6003 = AB/BC ... (1)

In the right angled ΔABD, tan 30° = AB/BD = AB/(BC + CD)

1/√3 = AB/(BC + 20) ... (2)

Dividing (1) by (2) we get,

1.6003 × √3 = (BC + 20)/BC

2.7717 = (BC + 20)/BC

2.7717 BC = BC + 20

1.7717 BC = 20

BC = 20/1.7717 = 11.29 m ... (3)

From (1), 1.6003 = AB/11.29

AB = 18.07

Hence, the height of the tower is 18.07 m and the width of the canal is 11.29 m.

### Example 6.24

An aeroplane sets off from G on a bearing of 24° towards H, a point 250 km away. At H it changes course and heads towards J, deviates further by 55° and a distance of 180 km away.

(i) How far is H to the North of G?
(ii) How far is H to the East of G?
(iii) How far is J to the North of H?
(iv) How far is J to the East of H?

(sin 24° = 0.4067, cos 24° = 0.9135, sin 11° = 0.1908, cos 11° = 0.9816)

![](fig.6.18(a).png)

**Fig. 6.18(a)**

![](fig.6.18(b).png)

**Fig. 6.18(b)**

**Solution:**

(i) In the right angled ΔGOH, cos 24° = OG/GH

0.9135 = OG/250

OG = 228.38 km

Distance of H to the North of G = 228.38 km

(ii) In the right angled ΔGOH, sin 24° = OH/GH

0.4067 = OH/250

OH = 101.68 km

Distance of H to the East of G = 101.68 km

(iii) In the right angled ΔHIJ, sin 11° = IJ/HJ

0.1908 = IJ/180

IJ = 34.34 km

Distance of J to the North of H = 34.34 km

(iv) In the right angled ΔHIJ, cos 11° = HI/HJ

0.9816 = HI/180

HI = 176.69 km

Distance of J to the East of H = 176.69 km

### Example 6.25

As shown in the figure, two trees are standing on flat ground. The angle of elevation of the top of both the trees from a point X on the ground is 40°. If the horizontal distance between X and the smaller tree is 8m and the distance of the top of the two trees is 20m, calculate

(i) the distance between the point X and the top of the smaller tree.
(ii) the horizontal distance between the two trees. (cos 40° = 0.7660)

![](fig.6.19.png)

**Fig. 6.19**

**Solution:**

Let AB be the height of the bigger tree and CD be the height of the smaller tree and X is the point on the ground.

(i) In the right angled ΔXCD, cos 40° = XC/XD

0.7660 = 8/XD

XD = 8/0.7660 = 10.44 m

Therefore, the distance between X and top of the smaller tree = XD = 10.44 m

(ii) In the right angled ΔXAB, cos 40° = XB/XA = (XC + CA)/(XD + DB)

Wait, let me re-read: cos 40° = XA/XB where XB is the distance from X to the foot of bigger tree, and XA is the line of sight to top of bigger tree.

Actually from the solution in the PDF:

0.7660 = (AC + 8)/(20 + 10.44)

AC + 8 = 0.7660 × 30.44 = 23.32

AC = 23.32 − 8 = 15.32 m

Therefore, the horizontal distance between two trees = 15.32 m

## Exercise 6.2

1. Find the angle of elevation of the top of a tower from a point on the ground, which is 30m away from the foot of a tower of height 10√3 m.

2. A road is flanked on either side by continuous rows of houses of height 4√3 m with no space in between them. A pedestrian is standing on the median of the road facing a row house. The angle of elevation from the pedestrian to the top of the house is 30°. Find the width of the road.

3. To a man standing outside his house, the angles of elevation of the top and bottom of a window are 60° and 45° respectively. If the height of the man is 180 cm and if he is 5 m away from the wall, what is the height of the window? (√3 = 1.732)

4. A statue 1.6 m tall stands on the top of a pedestal. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of the statue is 60° and from the same point the angle of elevation of the top of the pedestal is 40°. Find the height of the pedestal. (tan 40° = 0.8391, √3 = 1.732)

5. A flag pole of height 'h' metres is on the top of the hemispherical dome of radius 'r' metres. A man is standing 7 m away from the dome. Seeing the top of the pole at an angle 45° and moving 5 m away from the dome and seeing the bottom of the pole at an angle 30°. Find (i) the height of the pole (ii) radius of the dome. (√3 = 1.73)

![](fig.6.20.png)

**Fig. 6.20**

6. The top of a 15 m high tower makes an angle of elevation of 60° with the bottom of an electronic pole and angle of elevation of 30° with the top of the pole. What is the height of the electric pole?

## 6.3.2 Problems involving Angle of Depression

&gt; **Note:** Angle of Depression and Angle of Elevation are equal because they are alternative angles.

![](fig.6.20.png)

In this section, we try to solve problems when Angles of depression are given.

### Example 6.26

A player sitting on the top of a tower of height 20 m observes the angle of depression of a ball lying on the ground as 60°. Find the distance between the foot of the tower and the ball. (√3 = 1.732).

![](fig.6.21.png)

**Fig. 6.21**

**Solution:**

Let BC be the height of the tower and A be the position of the ball lying on the ground.

Then, BC = 20 m and ∠XCA = ∠CAB = 60°

Let AB = x metres.

In the right angled ΔABC,

tan 60° = BC/AB

√3 = 20/x

x = 20/√3 = (20√3)/3 = (20 × 1.732)/3 = 11.55 m.

Hence, the distance between the foot of the tower and the ball is 11.55 m.

### Example 6.27

The horizontal distance between two buildings is 140 m. The angle of depression of the top of the first building when seen from the top of the second building is 30°. If the height of the first building is 60 m, find the height of the second building. (√3 = 1.732)

![](fig.6.22.png)

**Fig. 6.22**

**Solution:**

The height of the first building AB = 60 m. Now, AB = MD = 60 m

Let the height of the second building CD = h

BD = 140 m

Now, AM = BD = 140 m

From the diagram, ∠XCA = 30° = ∠CAM

In the right angled ΔAMC, tan 30° = CM/AM

1/√3 = CM/140

CM = 140/√3 = (140√3)/3 = (140 × 1.732)/3 = 80.83

Now, h = CD = CM + MD = 80.83 + 60 = 140.83

Therefore, the height of the second building is 140.83 m.

### Example 6.28

From the top of a tower 50 m high, the angles of depression of the top and bottom of a vertical lamp post are observed to be 30° and 45° respectively. Find the height of the lamp post. (√3 = 1.732)

![](fig.6.23.png)

**Fig. 6.23**

**Solution:**

The height of the tower AB = 50 m

Let the height of the tree CD = y and BD = x

From the diagram, ∠XAC = 30° = ∠ACM and ∠XAD = 45° = ∠ADB

In the right angled ΔABD,

tan 45° = AB/BD

1 = 50/x ⇒ x = 50 m

In the right angled ΔAMC,

tan 30° = AM/CM

1/√3 = AM/50 [∵ DB = CM]

AM = 50/√3 = (50√3)/3 = (50 × 1.732)/3 = 28.87 m.

Therefore, height of the tree = CD = MB = AB − AM = 50 − 28.87 = 21.13 m

### Example 6.29

As observed from the top of a 60 m high lighthouse from the sea level, the angles of depression of two ships are 28° and 45°. If one ship is exactly behind the other on the same side of the lighthouse, find the distance between the two ships. (tan 28° = 0.5317)

![](fig.6.24.png)

**Fig. 6.24**

**Solution:**

Let the observer on the lighthouse CD be at D.

Height of the lighthouse CD = 60 m

From the diagram,

∠XDA = 28° = ∠DAC

∠XDB = 45° = ∠DBC

In the right angled ΔDCB, tan 45° = DC/BC

1 = 60/BC ⇒ BC = 60 m

In the right angled ΔDCA, tan 28° = DC/AC

0.5317 = 60/AC ⇒ AC = 60/0.5317 = 112.85

Distance between the two ships AB = AC − BC = 112.85 − 60 = 52.85 m

### Example 6.30

A man is watching a boat speeding away from the top of a tower. The boat makes an angle of depression of 60° with the man's eye when at a distance of 200 m from the tower. After 10 seconds, the angle of depression becomes 45°. What is the approximate speed of the boat (in km/hr), assuming that it is sailing in still water? (√3 = 1.732)

![](fig.6.25.png)

**Fig. 6.25**

**Solution:**

Let AB be the tower.

Let C and D be the positions of the boat.

From the diagram, ∠XAC = 60° = ∠ACB and ∠XAD = 45° = ∠ADB, BC = 200 m

In the right angled ΔABC, tan 60° = AB/BC

√3 = AB/200

we get AB = 200√3 ... (1)

In the right angled ΔABD, tan 45° = AB/BD

1 = (200√3)/BD [by (1)]

we get, BD = 200√3

Now, CD = BD − BC = 200√3 − 200 = 200(√3 − 1) = 200(0.732) = 146.4 m

It is given that the distance CD is covered in 10 seconds.

That is, the distance of 146.4 m is covered in 10 seconds.

Therefore, speed of the boat = distance/time = 146.4/10 m/s = 14.64 m/s

= 14.64 × (3600/1000) km/hr = 14.64 × 3.6 km/hr = 52.704 km/hr

## Exercise 6.3

1. From the top of a rock 50√3 m high, the angle of depression of a car on the ground is observed to be 30°. Find the distance of the car from the rock.

2. The horizontal distance between two buildings is 70 m. The angle of depression of the top of the first building when seen from the top of the second building is 45°. If the height of the second building is 120 m, find the height of the first building.

3. From the top of the tower 60 m high the angles of depression of the top and bottom of a vertical lamp post are observed to be 38° and 60° respectively. Find the height of the lamp post. (tan 38° = 0.7813, √3 = 1.732)

4. An aeroplane at an altitude of 1800 m finds that two boats are sailing towards it in the same direction. The angles of depression of the boats as observed from the aeroplane are 60° and 30° respectively. Find the distance between the two boats. (√3 = 1.732)

5. From the top of a lighthouse, the angle of depression of two ships on the opposite sides of it are observed to be 30° and 60°. If the height of the lighthouse is h meters and the line joining the ships passes through the foot of the lighthouse, show that the distance between the ships is (4h/√3) m.

6. A lift in a building of height 90 feet with transparent glass walls is descending from the top of the building. At the top of the building, the angle of depression to a fountain in the garden is 60°. Two minutes later, the angle of depression reduces to 30°. If the fountain is 30√3 feet from the entrance of the lift, find the speed of the lift which is descending.

## 6.3.3 Problems involving Angle of Elevation and Depression

Let us consider the following situation.

A man standing at a top of lighthouse located in a beach watch on aeroplane flying above the sea. At the same instant he watch a ship sailing in the sea. The angle with which he watch the plane correspond to angle of elevation and the angle of watching the ship corresponding to angle of depression. This is one example were one observes both angle of elevation and angle of depression.

In the Fig. 6.26, x° is the angle of elevation and y° is the angle of depression.

![](fig.6.26.png)

**Fig. 6.26**

In this section, we try to solve problems when Angles of elevation and depression are given.

### Example 6.31

From the top of a 12 m high building, the angle of elevation of the top of a cable tower is 60° and the angle of depression of its foot is 30°. Determine the height of the tower.

![](fig.6.27.png)

**Fig. 6.27**

**Solution:**

As shown in Fig. 6.27, OA is the building, O is the point of observation on the top of the building OA. Then, OA = 12 m.

PP' is the cable tower with P as the top and P' as the bottom.

Then the angle of elevation of P, ∠MOP = 60°

And the angle of depression of P', ∠OP'P = 30°.

PP' = h

Through O, draw OM ⊥ PP'

MP = PP' − MP' = h − OA = h − 12

In the right angled ΔOMP, MP/OM = tan 60°

(h − 12)/OM = √3

OM = (h − 12)/√3 ... (1)

In the right angled ΔOMP', MP'/OM = tan 30°

12/OM = 1/√3

OM = 12√3 ... (2)

From (1) and (2) we have,

(h − 12)/√3 = 12√3

h − 12 = 12√3 × √3 = 36

h = 48

Hence, the required height of the cable tower is 48 m.

### Example 6.32

A pole 5 m high is fixed on the top of a tower. The angle of elevation of the top of the pole observed from a point 'A' on the ground is 60° and the angle of depression to the point 'A' from the top of the tower is 45°. Find the height of the tower. (√3 = 1.732)

![](fig.6.28.png)

**Fig. 6.28**

**Solution:**

Let BC be the height of the tower and CD be the height of the pole.

Let 'A' be the point of observation.

Let BC = x and AB = y.

From the diagram, ∠BAD = 60° and ∠XCA = 45° = ∠BAC

In the right angled ΔABC, tan 45° = BC/AB

1 = x/y ⇒ x = y ... (1)

In the right angled ΔABD, tan 60° = BD/AB = (BC + CD)/AB

√3 = (x + 5)/y

√3 y = x + 5 ... (2)

From (1) and (2), we get √3 x = x + 5

x(√3 − 1) = 5

x = 5/(√3 − 1) = (5(√3 + 1))/((√3 − 1)(√3 + 1)) = (5(1.732 + 1))/2 = (5 × 2.732)/2 = 6.83

Hence, height of the tower is 6.83 m.

### Example 6.33

From a window (h metres high above the ground) of a house in a street, the angles of elevation and depression of the top and the foot of another house on the opposite side of the street are θ₁ and θ₂ respectively. Show that the height of the opposite house is h(1 + (cot θ₂)/(cot θ₁)).

![](fig.6.29.png)

**Fig. 6.29**

**Solution:**

Let W be the point on the window where the angles of elevation and depression are measured.

Let PQ be the house on the opposite side.

Then WA is the width of the street.

Height of the window = h metres = AQ (WR = AQ)

Let PA = x

In the right angled ΔPAW, tan θ₁ = AP/AW = x/AW

∴ AW = x/tan θ₁ = x cot θ₁ ... (1)

In the right angled ΔQAW, tan θ₂ = AQ/AW = h/AW

∴ AW = h/tan θ₂ = h cot θ₂ ... (2)

From (1) and (2) we get,

x cot θ₁ = h cot θ₂

x = h(cot θ₂)/(cot θ₁)

Therefore, height of the opposite house = PA + AQ = x + h = h(cot θ₂)/(cot θ₁) + h = h(1 + (cot θ₂)/(cot θ₁))

Hence Proved.

## Points to Remember

- An equation involving trigonometric ratios of an angle is called a trigonometric identity if it is true for all values of the angle.
- Trigonometric identities:
  - (i) sin²θ + cos²θ = 1
  - (ii) 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ
  - (iii) 1 + cot²θ = cosec²θ
- The line of sight is the line drawn from the eye of an observer to the point in the object viewed by the observer.
- The angle of elevation of an object viewed is the angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when it is above the horizontal level.
- The angle of depression of an object viewed is the angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when it is below the horizontal level.
- The height or length of an object or distance between two distant objects can be determined with the help of trigonometric ratios.
