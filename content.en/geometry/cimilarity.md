##  Similarity

Two figures are said to be similar if every aspect of one figure is proportional to other figure. For example:

The above houses look the same but different in size. Both the mobile phones are the same but they vary in their sizes. Therefore, mathematically we say that two objects are similar if they are of same shape but not necessarily they need to have the same size. The ratio of the corresponding measurements of two similar objects must be proportional.

Here is a box of geometrical shapes. Collect the similar objects and
![house](house.png)![phone](phone.png)

list out.

In this chapter, we will be discussing specifically the use of similar triangles which is of utmost importance where if it is beyond our reach to physically measure the distance and height with simple measuring instruments. The concept of similarity is widely used in the fields of engineering, architecture and construction.

Here are few applications of similarity

1. By analyzing the shadows that make triangles, we can determine the actual height of the objects.

![house](gandhi.png)

2. Used in aerial photography to determine the distance from sky to a particular location on the ground.
3. Used in Architecture to aid in design of their work.

###  Similar triangles

In class IX, we have studied congruent triangles. We can say that two geometrical figures are congruent, if they have same size and shape. But, here we shall study about geometrical figures which have same shape but proportional sizes. These figures are called "similar".

**Congruency and similarity of triangles**

Congruency is a particular case of similarity. In both the cases, three angles of one triangle are equal to the three corresponding angles of the other triangle. But in congruent triangles, the corresponding sides are equal. While in similar triangles, the corresponding sides are proportional.

![alt text](concurrent.png)

$\triangle A B C \cong \triangle P Q R$

$\angle A=\angle P, \angle B=\angle Q, \angle C=\angle R$.

$\triangle A B C \sim \triangle P Q R$

$A B=P Q, B C=Q R, C A=R P$

$\frac{A B}{P Q}=\frac{B C}{Q R}=\frac{C A}{R P}=1$

Same shape and same size.
Note

The traingles $A B C$ and $P Q R$ are similar can be written as $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle P Q R$ $\angle A=\angle P, \angle B=\angle Q, \angle C=\angle R$ $A B \neq P Q, B C \neq Q R, C A \neq R P$ but $\frac{A B}{P Q}=\frac{B C}{Q R}=\frac{C A}{R P}>1$ or $<1$

Same shape but not same size.


###  Criteria of Similarity

The following criteria are sufficient to prove that two triangles are similar.

**AA Criterion of similarity**

If two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another triangle, then the two triangles are similar, because the third angle in both triangles must be equal. Therefore, AA similarity criterion is same as the AAA similarity criterion.

![alt text](4.6.png)

So if $\angle A=\angle P=1$ and $\angle B=\angle Q=2$ then $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle P Q R$.

**SAS Criterion of similarity**

If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and if the sides including them are proportional then the two triangles are similar.

Thus if $\angle A=\angle P=1$ and

$$
\frac{A B}{P Q}=\frac{A C}{P R} \text { then } \triangle A B C \sim \triangle P Q R
$$

![alt text](4.7.png)

**SSS Criterion of similarity**

If three sides of a triangle are proportional to the three corresponding sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are similar.

So if, $\frac{A B}{P Q}=\frac{A C}{P R}=\frac{B C}{Q R}$ then $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle P Q R$

**Some useful results on similar triangles**

1. A perpendicular line drawn from the vertex of a right angled triangle divides the triangle into two triangles similar to each other and also to original triangle.

$\triangle A D B \sim \triangle B D C, \triangle A B C \sim \triangle A D B, \triangle A B C \sim \triangle B D C$

![alt text](4.9.png)

2. If two triangles are similar, then the ratio of the corresponding sides are equal to the ratio of their corresponding altitudes.

i.e. if $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle P Q R$ then

![alt text](4.10.png)

$$
\frac{A B}{P Q}=\frac{B C}{Q R}=\frac{C A}{R P}=\frac{A D}{P S}=\frac{B E}{Q T}=\frac{C F}{R U}
$$



![alt text](4.11.png)

$$
\frac{A B}{D E}=\frac{B C}{E F}=\frac{C A}{F D}=\frac{A B+B C+C A}{D E+E F+F D}
$$

4. The ratio of the area of two similar triangles are equal to the ratio of the squares of their corresponding sides.

$$
\frac{\operatorname{area}(\triangle A B C)}{\operatorname{area}(\triangle P Q R)}=\frac{A B^{2}}{P Q^{2}}=\frac{B C^{2}}{Q R^{2}}=\frac{A C^{2}}{P R^{2}}
$$
![alt text](4.12.png)

5. If two triangles have common vertex and their bases are on the same straight line, the ratio between their areas is equal to the ratio between the length of their bases.

$$
\text { Here, } \frac{\operatorname{area}(\triangle A B D)}{\operatorname{area}(\triangle B D C)}=\frac{A D}{D C} \text {. }
$$

**Illustration** Two triangles, $\triangle X Y Z$ and $\triangle L M N$ are similar because the corresponding angles are equal.

![alt text](4.14.png)
![alt text](note2.png)

1. $\angle X=\angle L, \angle Y=\angle M, \angle Z=\angle N$ (by angles)

Here the vertices $X, Y, Z$ correspond to the vertices $L, M, N$ respectively. Thus in symbol $\triangle X Y Z \sim \triangle L M N$

**Example 4.1** Show that $\triangle P S T \sim \triangle P Q R$

![alt text](4.15.png)
![alt text](4.16.png)

**Solution**

1. In $\triangle P S T$ and $\triangle P Q R$,

$$
\frac{P S}{P Q}=\frac{2}{2+1}=\frac{2}{3}, \frac{P T}{P R}=\frac{4}{4+2}=\frac{2}{3}
$$

Thus, $\frac{P S}{P Q}=\frac{P T}{P R}$ and $\angle P$ is common

Therefore, by $S A S$ similarity,

2. $\triangle P S T \sim \triangle P Q R$

$$
\frac{P S}{P Q}=\frac{2}{2+3}=\frac{2}{5}, \frac{P T}{P R}=\frac{2}{2+3}=\frac{2}{5}
$$

Thus, $\frac{P S}{P Q}=\frac{P T}{P R}$ and $\angle P$ is common

Therefore, by SAS similarity,

$\triangle P S T \sim \triangle P Q R$

**Example 4.2**  Is $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle P Q R$ ?

**Solution** In $\triangle A B C$ and $\triangle P Q R$,

$$
\frac{P Q}{A B}=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2} ; \frac{Q R}{B C}=\frac{4}{10}=\frac{2}{5}
$$

since $\frac{1}{2} \neq \frac{2}{5}, \frac{P Q}{A B} \neq \frac{Q R}{B C}$.

The corresponding sides are not proportional.

Therefore $\triangle A B C$ is not similar to $\triangle P Q R$.

![alt text](4.17.png)

![alt text](note3.png)

**Example 4.3** Observe Fig.4.18 and find $\angle P$.

**Solution** In $\triangle B A C$ and $\triangle P R Q, \frac{A B}{R Q}=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$;

$$
\frac{B C}{Q P}=\frac{6}{12}=\frac{1}{2} ; \frac{C A}{P R}=\frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{6 \sqrt{3}}=\frac{1}{2}
$$

Therefore, $\frac{A B}{R Q}=\frac{B C}{Q P}=\frac{C A}{P R}$

By $S S S$ similarity, we have $\triangle B A C \sim \triangle Q R P$

![alt text](4.18.png)

$\angle P=\angle C$ (since the corresponding parts of similar triangle)

$\angle P=\angle C=180^{\circ}-(\angle A+\angle B)=180^{\circ}-\left(90^{\circ}+60^{\circ}\right)$

$\angle P=180^{\circ}-150^{\circ}=30^{\circ}$

**Example 4.4** A boy of height $90 \mathrm{~cm}$ is walking away from the base of a lamp post at a speed of $1.2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$. If the lamppost is $3.6 \mathrm{~m}$ above the ground, find the length of his shadow cast after 4 seconds.

**Solution** Given, speed $=1.2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { time } & =4 \text { seconds } \\
\text { distance } & =\text { speed } \times \text { time } \\
& =1.2 \times 4=4.8 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $x$ be the length of the shadow

![alt text](4.19.png) 

after 4 seconds

Since, $\triangle A B E \sim \triangle C D E, \frac{B E}{D E}=\frac{A B}{C D}$ gives $\frac{4.8+x}{x}=\frac{3.6}{0.9}=4 \quad($ since $90 \mathrm{~cm}=0.9 \mathrm{~m})$

$$
4.8+x=4 x \text { gives } 3 x=4.8 \text { so, } x=1.6 \mathrm{~m}
$$

The length of his shadow $D E=1.6 \mathrm{~m}$

**Example 4.5** In Fig.4.20 $\angle A=\angle C E D$ prove that $\triangle C A B \sim \triangle C E D$. Also find the value of $x$.

**Solution** In $\triangle C A B$ and $\triangle C E D, \angle C$ is common, $\angle A=\angle C E D$

Therefore, $\triangle C A B \sim \triangle C E D$ (By $A A$ similarity)

Hence, $\frac{C A}{C E}=\frac{A B}{D E}=\frac{C B}{C D}$

$$
\frac{A B}{D E}=\frac{C B}{C D} \text { gives } \frac{9}{x}=\frac{10+2}{8} \text { so, } x=\frac{8 \times 9}{12}=6 \mathrm{~cm} .
$$

![alt text](4.20.png)

**Example 4.6** In Fig.4.21, $Q A$ and $P B$ are perpendiculars to $A B$. If $A O=10 \mathrm{~cm}$, $B O=6 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $P B=9 \mathrm{~cm}$. Find $A Q$.

**Solution** In $\triangle A O Q$ and $\triangle B O P, \angle O A Q=\angle O B P=90^{\circ}$

$\angle A O Q=\angle B O P \quad$ (Vertically opposite angles)

Therefore, by $A A$ Criterion of similarity,

$\triangle A O Q \sim \triangle B O P$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{A O}{B O} & =\frac{O Q}{O P}=\frac{A Q}{B P} \\
\frac{10}{6} & =\frac{A Q}{9} \Rightarrow A Q=\frac{10 \times 9}{6}=15 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}
$$

![alt text](4.21.png)

**Example 4.7** The perimeters of two similar triangles $A B C$ and $P Q R$ are respectively $36 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $24 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $P Q=10 \mathrm{~cm}$, find $A B$.

**Solution** The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is same as the ratio of their perimeters.

Since $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle P Q R$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{A B}{P Q}=\frac{B C}{Q R}=\frac{A C}{P R}=\frac{36}{24} \\
& \frac{A B}{P Q}=\frac{36}{24} \Rightarrow \frac{A B}{10}=\frac{36}{24} \\
& A B=\frac{36 \times 10}{24}=15 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}
$$

![alt text](4.22.png)

**Example 4.8** If $\triangle A B C$ is similar to $\triangle D E F$ such that $B C=3 \mathrm{~cm}, E F=4 \mathrm{~cm}$ and area of $\triangle A B C=54 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. Find the area of $\triangle D E F$.

**Solution** Since the ratio of area of two similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the squares of any two corresponding sides, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\operatorname{Area}(\triangle A B C)}{\operatorname{Area}(\triangle D E F)}=\frac{B C^{2}}{E F^{2}} \Rightarrow \frac{54}{\operatorname{Area}(\triangle D E F)}=\frac{3^{2}}{4^{2}} \\
& \text { Area }(\triangle D E F)=\frac{16 \times 54}{9}=96 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Example 4.9** Two poles of height ' $a$ ' metres and ' $b$ ' metres are ' $p$ ' metres apart. Prove that the height of the point of intersection of the lines joining the top of each pole to the foot of the opposite pole is given by $\frac{a b}{a+b}$ metres.

**Solution** Let $A B$ and $C D$ be two poles of height ' $a$ ' metres and ' $b$ ' metres respectively such that the poles are ' $p$ ' metres apart. That is $A C=p$

![alt text](4.23.png)

 metres. Suppose the lines $A D$ and $B C$ meet at $O$, such that $O L=h$ metres

Let $C L=x$ and $L A=y$.

Then, $x+y=p$

In $\triangle A B C$ and $\triangle L O C$, we have

$\angle C A B=\angle C L O$ [ each equal to $90^{\circ}$ ]

$\angle C=\angle C[C$ is common]

$\triangle C A B \sim \triangle C L O$ [By $A A$ similarity]

$\frac{C A}{C L}=\frac{A B}{L O} \Rightarrow \frac{p}{x}=\frac{a}{h}$

so, $\quad x=\frac{p h}{a}$

In $\triangle A L O$ and $\triangle A C D$, we have

$\angle A L O=\angle A C D$ [each equal to $90^{\circ}$ ]

$\angle A=\angle A[\mathrm{~A}$ is common]

$\triangle A L O \sim \triangle A C D$ [by AA similarity]

$\frac{A L}{A C}=\frac{O L}{D C} \Rightarrow \frac{y}{p}=\frac{h}{b}$ we get, $y=\frac{p h}{b}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1)+(2) \Rightarrow \quad x+y & =\frac{p h}{a}+\frac{p h}{b} \\
p & =p h\left(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}\right) \quad(\text { Since } x+y=p) \\
1 & =h\left(\frac{a+b}{a b}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

![alt text](progresscheck.png)

Therefore, $h=\frac{a b}{a+b}$

Hence, the height of the intersection of the lines joining the top of each pole to the foot of the opposite pole is $\frac{a b}{a+b}$ metres.

###  Construction of similar triangles

So far we have discussed the theoretical approach of similar triangles and their properties. Now we shall discuss the geometrical construction of a triangle similar to a given triangle whose sides are in a given ratio with the corresponding sides of the given triangle.

This construction includes two different cases. In one, the triangle to be constructed is smaller and in the other it is larger than the given triangle. So, we use the following term called "scale factor" which measures the ratio of the sides of the triangle to be constructed with the corresponding sides of the given triangle. Let us take the following examples involving the two cases:

**Example 4.10** Construct a triangle similar to a given triangle $P Q R$ with its sides equal to $\frac{3}{5}$ of the corresponding sides of the triangle $P Q R$ (scale factor $\frac{3}{5}<1$ )

**Solution** Given a triangle $P Q R$ we are required to construct another triangle whose sides are $\frac{3}{5}$ of the corresponding sides of the triangle $P Q R$.

![alt text](rough1.png)



**Steps of construction**

1. Construct a $\triangle P Q R$ with any measurement.
2. Draw a ray $Q X$ making an acute angle with $Q R$ on the side opposite to vertex $P$.
3. Locate 5 (the greater of 3 and 5 in $\frac{3}{5}$ ) points.

$Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}, Q_{4}$ and $Q_{5}$ on $Q X$ so that

$Q Q_{1}=Q_{1} Q_{2}=Q_{2} Q_{3}=Q_{3} Q_{4}=Q_{4} Q_{5}$

![alt text](4.25.png)

4. Join $Q_{5} R$ and draw a line through $Q_{3}$ (the third point, 3 being smaller of 3 and 5 in $\frac{3}{5}$ ) parallel to $Q_{5} R$ to intersect $\mathrm{QR}$ at $R^{\prime}$.
5. Draw line through $R^{\prime}$ parallel to the line $R P$ to intersect QP at $P^{\prime}$.

Then, $\Delta P^{\prime} Q R^{\prime}$ is the required triangle each of whose sides is threefifths of the corresponding sides of $\triangle P Q R$.

**Example 4.11** Construct a triangle similar to a given triangle $P Q R$ with its sides equal to $\frac{7}{4}$ of the corresponding sides of the triangle $P Q R$ (scale factor $\frac{7}{4}>1$ )

![alt text](rough2.png)

**Solution** Given a triangle $P Q R$, we are required to construct another triangle whose sides are $\frac{7}{4}$ of the corresponding sides of the triangle $P Q R$.

![alt text](4.26.png)

**Steps of construction**

1. Construct a $\triangle P Q R$ with any measurement.
2. Draw a ray $Q X$ making an acute angle with $Q R$ on the side opposite to vertex $P$.
3. Locate 7 points (the greater of 7 and 4 in $\frac{7}{4}$ ) $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, Q_{3}, Q_{4}, Q_{5}, Q_{6}$ and $Q_{7}$ on $Q X$ so that $Q Q_{1}=Q_{1} Q_{2}=Q_{2} Q_{3}=Q_{3} Q_{4}=Q_{4} Q_{5}=Q_{5} Q_{6}=Q_{6} Q_{7}$
4. Join $Q_{4}$ (the 4 th point, 4 being smaller of 4 and 7 in $\frac{7}{4}$ ) to $R$ and draw a line through $Q_{7}$ parallel to $Q_{4} R$, intersecting the extended line segment $Q R$ at $R^{\prime}$.
5. Draw a line through $R^{\prime}$ parallel to $R P$ intersecting the extended line segment $Q P$ at $P^{\prime}$ Then $\Delta P^{\prime} Q R^{\prime}$ is the required triangle each of whose sides is seven-fourths of the corresponding sides of $\triangle P Q R$.

2. A girl looks the reflection of the top of the lamp post on the mirror which is $6.6 \mathrm{~m}$ away from the foot of the lamppost. The girl whose height is $1.25 \mathrm{~m}$ is standing $2.5 \mathrm{~m}$ away from the mirror. Assuming the mirror is placed on the ground facing the sky and the girl, mirror and the lamppost are in a same line, find the height of the lamp post.
3. A vertical stick of length $6 \mathrm{~m}$ casts a shadow $400 \mathrm{~cm}$ long on the ground and at the same time a tower casts a shadow $28 \mathrm{~m}$ long. Using similarity, find the height of the tower.
4. Two triangles $Q P R$ and $Q S R$, right angled at $P$ and $S$ respectively are drawn on the same base $Q R$ and on the same side of $Q R$. If $P R$ and $S Q$ intersect at $T$, prove that $P T \times T R=S T \times T Q$.
5. In the adjacent figure, $\triangle A B C$ is right angled at $\mathrm{C}$ and $D E \perp A B$. Prove that $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle A D E$ and hence find the lengths of $A E$ and $D E$.
6. In the adjacent figure, $\triangle A C B \sim \triangle A P Q$. If $B C=8 \mathrm{~cm}$, $P Q=4 \mathrm{~cm}, B A=6.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $A P=2.8 \mathrm{~cm}$, find $C A$ and $A Q$.
