# Conversion of Solids from one shape to another with no change in Volume

Conversions or Transformations becomes a common part of our daily life. For 
example, a gold smith melts a bar of gold to transform it to a jewel. Similarly, a kid playing 
with clay shapes it into different toys, a carpenter uses the wooden logs to form different 
house hold articles/furniture. Likewise, the conversion of solids from one shape to another 
is required for various purposes.

In this section we will be learning problems involving conversions of solids from one 
shape to another with no change in volume.

**Example 7.29**  A metallic sphere of radius 16 cm is melted and recast into small spheres 
each of radius 2 cm. How many small spheres can be obtained?

**Solution**  Let the number of small spheres obtained be n.

Let r be the radius of each small sphere and R be the radius of metallic sphere.

Here, R = 16 cm, r = 2 cm

Now, n x (Volume of a small sphere) = Volume of big metallic sphere

 n (4/3 &#960; $r^{3}$) =  4/3 &#960; $R^{3}$

n(4/3 &#960; x $2^{3}$)= 4/3 &#960; x $16^{3}$

 8 n= 4096  ⇒ n = 512

Therefore, there will be 512 small spheres.


**Example 7.30**  A cone of height 24 cm is made up of modeling clay. A child reshapes it in 
the form of a cylinder of same radius as cone. Find the height of the cylinder.

**Solution** Let h1 and h2 be the heights of a cone and cylinder respectively.

Also, let r be the raius of the cone.

Given that, height of the cone h1 = 24 cm; radius of the cone and cylinder r = 6 cm

Since, Volume of cylinder = Volume of cone

 &#960; $r^{2}$ h2= 1/3 &#960; $r^{2}$ h1
 
 h2 = 1/3 x h1 ⇒ h2
1/3 × 24 = 8

Therefore, height of cylinder is 8 cm


**Example 7.31**  A right circular cylindrical container of base radius 6 cm and height 15 cm 
is full of ice cream. The ice cream is to be filled in cones of height 9 cm and base radius 3
cm, having a hemispherical cap. Find the number of cones needed to empty the container.

**Solution** Let h and r be the height and radius of the cylinder respectively.

 Given that, h = 15 cm, r = 6 cm

 ---


 Volume of the container V = &#960;$r^{2}$ h cubic units.

 = 22/7 x 6 x 6 x 15

Let, r1 = 3 cm, h1 = 9 cm be the radius and height of the cone. 

Also, r1 = 3 cm is the radius of the hemispherical cap.

Volume of one ice cream cone =(Volume of the cone + Volume of the hemispherical cap)

 = 1/3 &#960; $r1^{2}$ h1 + 2/3 &#960; $r1^{3}$

 =1/3 x 22/7 x 3 x 3 x 9 + 2/3 x 22/7 x 3 x 3 x 3

 = 22/7 x 9(3 + 2) = 22/7 x 45

 Number of cones =   volume of the cylinder /
volume of one ice cream cone

Number of ice cream cones needed=
22/7 x 6 x 6 x 15
/ 22/7 x 45    = 12

Thus 12 ice cream cones are required to empty the cylindrical container.
