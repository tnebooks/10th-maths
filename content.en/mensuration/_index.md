# Mensuration

“Nature is an infinite sphere of which the centre is everywhere and 
the circumference nowhere”.
                                               
                                         - Blaise Pascal

  Pappus
290 - 350 AD(CE) ![Figure with 50%](img1.png "w-50 float-end")

   Pappus, born at Alexandria, Egypt is the last of the great Greek 
geometers. Pappus major work ‘Synagoge’ or ‘The Mathematical 
Collection’ is a collection of mathematical writings in eight books. 

He described the principles of levers, pulleys, wedges, axles 
and screws. These concepts are widely applied in Physics and 
modern Engineering Science.

## Introduction

The ancient cultures throughout the world sought the idea of measurements for 
<!-- satisfying their daily needs. <img src="img2.png" alt="pappus" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" height=350px; width=400px;/> -->
![Figure with 50%](img2.png "w-50 float-end")
For 
example, they had to know how 
much area of crops needed to be 
grown in a given region; how 
much could a container hold? 
etc. These questions were very 
important for making decisions 
in agriculture and trade. They 
needed efficient and compact 
way of doing this. It is for this 
reason, mathematicians thought 
of applying geometry to real life 
situations to attain useful results. 
This was the reason for the origin 
of mensuration. Thus, mensuration can be thought as applied geometry.

We are already familiar with the areas of plane figures like square, rectangle, triangle, 
circle etc. These figures are called 2-dimensional shapes as they can be drawn in a plane. 
But most of the objects which we come across in our daily life cannot be represented in a 
plane. For example, tubes, water tanks, bricks, ice-cream cones, football etc. These objects 
are called solid shapes or 3-dimensional shapes.

We often see solids like cube, cuboid, prism and pyramid. For three dimensional 
objects measurements like surface area and volume exist.

In this chapter, we shall study about the surface area and volume 
of some of the standard solid shapes such as cylinder, cone, sphere, 
hemisphere and frustum.



## Surface Area

Surface area is the measurement of all exposed area of a solid object.

### Right Circular Cylinder


Observe the given figures in Fig.7.2 and 
identify the shape.


These objects resemble the shape of a 
cylinder.


<div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color:red;">Definition :</span> A right circular cylinder is a solid generated by the revolution 
of a rectangle about one of its sides as axis.
</div>


<!-- <img src="fig7.3.png" alt="omar" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.3.png "w-50 float-end")
If the axis is perpendicular to the radius then the cylinder is called 
a right circular cylinder. In the Fig.7.3, AB = h represent the height and 
AD = r represent the radius of the cylinder.


<!-- A solid cylinder is an object bounded by two <img src="fig7.4.png" alt="fig7.4" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" heigth=250px; /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.4.png "w-50 float-end")
circular plane surfaces and a curved surface. The 
area between the two circular bases is called its 
‘Lateral Surface Area’ (L.S.A.) or ‘Curved Surface 
Area’ (C.S.A.).




**Formation of a Right Circular Cylinder – Demonstration**


1. Take a rectangle sheet of a paper of length l and breadth b.

<!-- 2. Revolve the paper about one of its <img src="fig7.5.png" alt="cylinder" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.5.png "w-50 float-end")
sides, say b to complete a full rotation 
(without overlapping).

3. The shape thus formed will be 
a right circular cylinder whose 
circumference of the base is l and the height is b.




---


**Surface Area of a Right Circular Cylinder**

1. Curved surface area

Curved surface area (C.S.A.) of a right circular cylinder

 = Area of the corresponding rectangle

 = l x b
 
 =  2&#960;r x h ( l is the circumference 
 
 = 2&#960;rh of the base, b is the height)[see Fig. 7.5]

<span style="background-color:blue; color:red;">
C.S.A. of a right circular cylinder = 2&#960;rh sq. units.
</span>

2. Total surface area

Total surface area refers to the sum of areas of the curved surface area and the two 
circular regions at the top and bottom.

That is, total surface area (T.S.A.) of right circular cylinder

 = C.S.A + Area of top circular region
 +Area of bottom circular region.

 = 2&#960;rh+&#960;rr+&#960;rr (Refer Fig7.4)

 =2&#960;rh+2&#960;rr

 = 2&#960;r(h+r)

 <span style="background-color:blue; color:red;">
T.S.A. of a right circular cylinder =  2&#960;r(h+r) sq. units </span>


<div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 10px;">
<ul style="color:red;">
 <li>We always consider p = 22/7 , unless otherwise stated. </li>
 <li> The term ‘surface area’ refers to ‘total surface area’</li></ul>
 </div>



**Example 7.1**   A cylindrical drum has a height of 20 cm and base radius of 14 cm. Find its 
curved surface area and the total surface area.

**Solution**  Given that, height of the cylinder h = 20 cm ; radius r =14 cm

Now, C.S.A. of the cylinder = 2prh sq. units

 C.S.A. of the cylinder = 2×22/7×14 ×20

= 2 x 22 x 2 x 20= 1760 cm2

 T.S.A. of the cylinder = + 2pr(h +r)  sq. units

 = 2x 22/7x14x(20+14)=2x22/7x14x34 
 = 2992 cm2 

Therefore, C.S.A. = 1760 cm2 and T.S.A. = 2992 cm2


---



**Example 7.2**  The curved surface area of a right circular cylinder of height 14 cm is 
88 cm2 . Find the diameter of the cylinder.
**Solution** Given that, C.S.A. of the cylinder =88 sq. cm 
 2&#960;rh = 88

 2x 22/7xrx14 = 88 (h=14 cm)

 2r = 88x 7 / 22x 14 = 2

 Therefore, diameter = 2 cm


**Example 7.3**   A garden roller whose length is 3 m long and whose diameter is 2.8 m is 
rolled to level a garden. How much area will it cover in 8 revolutions?
<!-- <img src="fig7.6.png" alt="cylinder" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.6.png "w-50 float-end")
**Solution** Given that, diameter d = 2.8 m and height = 3 m

 radius r = 1.4 m

 Area covered in one revolution = curved surface area of the cylinder

 = 2&#960;rh sq. units

 = 2x22/7x1.4x3 =26.4

 Area covered in 1 revolution = 26.4 m2 

Area covered in 8 revolutions = ×8 26 4. = 211.2

Therefore, area covered is 211.2 m2




**Thinking Corner**

1. When ‘h’ coins each of radius ‘r’ units and thickness 1 unit is stacked one upon the 
other, what would be the solid object you get? Also find its C.S.A. 
2. When the radius of a cylinder is double its height, find the relation between its 
C.S.A. and base area.
3. Two circular cylinders are formed by rolling two rectangular aluminum sheets each 
of dimensions 12 m length and 5 m breadth, one by rolling along its length and the 
other along its width. Find the ratio of their curved surface areas.


### Hollow Cylinder

An object bounded by two co-axial cylinders of the same height and 
different radii is called a ‘hollow cylinder’. 
Let R and r be the outer and inner radii of the cylinder. Let h be its height.
<!-- <img src="fig7.7.png" alt="cylinder2" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.7.png "w-50 float-end")
C.S.A of the hollow cylinder = outer C.S.A. of the cylinder 
 + inner C.S.A. of the cylinder

 = 2&#960;Rh+2&#960;rh

 <span style="background-color:blue; color:red;">
C.S.A of a hollow cylinder= 2&#960;(R+r)h sq. units
</span>


---


T.S.A. of the hollow cylinder =C.S.A. + Area of two rings at the top and bottom.

 = 2&#960;(R+r)h+ 2&#960;(R^2 - r^2)

<span style="background-color:blue; color:red;">
T.S.A. of a hollow cylinder= 2&#960;(R+r)(R-r+h) sq. units. </span>


**Example 7.4**   If one litre of paint covers 10 m2, how many litres of paint is required to 
paint the internal and external surface areas of a cylindrical tunnel whose 
thickness is 2 m, internal radius is 6 m and height is 25 m. 

<!-- <img src="fig7.8.png" alt="cylinder3" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.8.png "w-50 float-end")
**Solution**   Given that, height h = 25 m; thickness = 2 m

 internal radius r = 6 m

Now, external radius R = +6 2 = 8 m

 C.S.A. of the cylindrical tunnel = C.S.A. of the hollow cylinder

 C.S.A. of the hollow cylinder = + 2&#960;( R+r) h sq. units

 = 2x22/7(8+6)x25

 Hence, C.S.A. of the cylindrical tunnel = 2200 m2 

 Area covered by one litre of paint = 10 m2

Number of litres required to paint the tunnel = 2200/10=220

Therefore, 220 litres of paint is needed to paint the tunnel.

### Right Circular Cone
<!-- <img src="fig7.9.png" alt="cylinder" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.9.png "w-50 float-end")
Observe the given figures in Fig.7.9 
and identify which solid shape they 
represent?

These objects resemble the shape of 
a cone.





---


<div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 10px;">
Definition : A right circular cone is a solid generated by the revolution of a 
right angled triangle about one of the sides containing the right angle as axis.
</div>


**Formation of a Right Circular Cone - Demonstration**

<!-- In Fig. 7.10, if the right triangle ABC revolves about AB as axis, the <img src="fig7.10.png" alt="cone" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.10.png "w-50 float-end")
hypotenuse AC generates the curved surface of the cone represented in the 
diagram. The height of the cone is the length of the axis AB, and the slant 
height is the length of the hypotenuse AC.


**Surface area of a right circular cone**

Suppose the surface area of the cone is cut ![Figure with 50%](fig7.11.png "w-50 float-end")
along the hypotenuse AC and then unrolled on 
a plane, the surface area will take the form of 
a sector ACD, of which the radius AC and the 
arc CD are respectively the slant height and the 
circumference of the base of the cone.
Here the sector of radius ‘l’ and arc length ‘s’ will be similar to a circle of radius l .

(i) Curved surface area

Area of sector          Arc length of the sector
__________________  =  ____________________________
Area of the circle       Circumference of the circle


 Area of the sector = Arc length of the sector
                     ____________________________ x Area of the circle       Circumference of the circle

= s/2&#960;l x &#960;l^2 =s/2xl = 2&#960;r/2 xl   (s=2&#960;r)



∴ Curved Surface Area of the cone = Area of the Sector = &#960;rl sq. units.

C.S.A. of a right circular cone = &#960;rl sq. units.


**Thinking Corner**

1. Give practical example of solid cone.
2. Find surface area of a cone in terms of its radius when height is equal to radius.
3. Compare the above surface area with the area of the base of the cone.
 
 
 **Activity 1**

(i) Take a semi-circular paper with radius 7 cm and make it a cone. Find the C.S.A. 
of the cone.

(ii) Take a quarter circular paper with radius 3.5 cm and make it a cone. Find the 
C.S.A. of the cone.


---

<span style="color:blue;">
Derivation of slant height ‘l’  </span>

<!-- ABC is a right angled triangle, right angled at B. The hypotenuse, <img src="fig7.12.png" alt="vertical cone" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.12.png "w-50 float-end")
base and height of the triangle are represented by l, r and h respectively.

Now, using Pythagoras theorem in DABC,

 AC 2 = + AB^2 + BC ^2

 l^2 = + h^2 + r^2

 l = (h^2+r^2)^(1/2) units

(ii) Total surface area
 Total surface area of a cone =C.S.A. + base area of the cone

 = &#960;rl+ &#960;r^2 ( the base is a circle)

<span style="background-color:blue; color:red;">
T.S.A. of a right circular cone= &#960;r (l+r) sq. units. </span>


**Example 7.5**  The radius of a conical tent is 7 m and the height is 24 m. Calculate the 
length of the canvas used to make the tent if the width of the rectangular canvas is 4 m?

**Solution**  Let r and h be the radius and height of the cone respectively.
Given that, radius r =7 m and height h = 24 m

 Hence, l = (r^2+ h^2)^(1/2)
        
        = (49+ 576)^(1/2)

 l = 625 = 25 m

 C.S.A. of the conical tent = &#960;rl sq. units

 Area of the canvas = 22/7x7x25 = 550 m2

 Now, length of the canvas = Area of the canvas
 _______________________ = 
      width
 = 550 /4
= 137.5 m

Therefore, the length of the canvas is 137.5 m


**Example 7.6**   If the total surface area of a cone of radius 7cm is 704 cm2, then find its 
slant height.

**Solution**   Given that, radius r = 7 cm
Now, total surface area of the cone = &#960;r(l+r) sq. units
 T.S.A. = 704 cm2

 704 = 22/7x 7(l+7)

 32 = l+ 7 ⇒ l = 25 cm

Therefore, slant height of the cone is 25 cm.



---



<!-- **Example 7.7**   From a solid cylinder whose height is 2.4 cm and <img src="fig7.13.png" alt="cone inside cylinder" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.13.png "w-50 float-end")
diameter 1.4 cm, a conical cavity of the same height and base is hollowed 
out (Fig.7.13). Find the total surface area of the remaining solid.

**Solution**  Let h and r be the height and radius of the cone and cylinder.
Let l be the slant height of the cone.
Given that, h = 2.4 cm and d = 1.4 cm ; r = 0.7 cm

Total surface area of the 
remaining solid = C.S.A. of the cylinder + C.S.A. of the cone 
+ area of the bottom

 = 2&#960;rh + &#960;rl + &#960;r^2 sq. units

 =&#960;r(2h+l+r) sq. units

Now, l  = (r^2+h^2)^(1/2)
= (0.49+5.76)^(1/2) = (.25)^(1/2) = 2 5. cm

 l = 2.5 cm

 Area of the remaining solid = &#960;r(2h+l+r) sq. units

 = 22/7x0.7x[(2x2.4)+2.5+0.7]

 = 17.6

Therefore, total surface area of the remaining solid is 17.6 cm2 


**Progress Check**
1. Right circular cone is a solid obtained by revolving ____ about ____.
2. In a right circular cone the axis is ____ to the diameter.
3. The difference between the C.S.A. and T.S.A. of a cone is ____.
4. When a sector of a circle is transformed to form a cone, then match the conversions 
taking place between the sector and the cone.

| Sector | Cone |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Radius | Circumference of the base|
| Area | Slant height |
| Arc | length Curved surface area|



### The Sphere

<div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 10px;">
Definition : A sphere is a solid generated by the revolution of a semicircle about its diameter as axis.
</div>

---






Every plane section of a sphere is a circle. The line of section of a sphere by a plane 
<!-- passing through the centre of the sphere is called a great circle <img src="fig7.14-fig7.15.png" alt="omar" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> --> ![Figure with 50%](fig7.14-fig7.15.png "w-50 float-end")
all other plane sections are called small circles.
As shown in the diagram, circle with CD as diameter is a 
great circle, whereas, the circle with QR as diameter is a small 
circle.


**Surface area of a sphere**

**Archimedes Proof**


Place a sphere inside a right circular cylinder of equal diameter 
and height. Then the height of the cylinder will be the diameter of 
the sphere. In this case, Archimedes proved that the outer area of 
the sphere is same as curved surface area of the cylinder.

Surface area of sphere =curved surface area of cylinder

 = 2&#960;rh = 2 &#960;r (2r)

<span style="background-color:blue; color:red;">
Surface area of a sphere = 4&#960;r^2 sq.units </span>



 **Activity 2**

(i) Take a sphere of radius ‘r’. 

(ii) Take a cylinder whose base diameter and height are equal to the diameter of the 
sphere.

(iii) Now, roll thread around the surface of the sphere and the cylinder without 
overlapping and leaving space between the threads.

(iv) Now compare the length of the two threads in both the cases.

(v) Use this information to find surface area of sphere.


### Hemisphere

A section of the sphere cut by a plane through any of its great 
circle is a hemisphere.

By doing this, we observe that a hemisphere is exactly half the 
portion of the sphere.

 Curved surface area of hemisphere = C.S.A. of the sphere /2 = 4&#960;r^2/2
 <span style="background-color:blue; color:red;">
C.S.A. of a hemisphere = 2&#960;r^2  sq.units </span>

 Total surface area of hemisphere = C.S.A. +Area of top circular region 
 
 = 2&#960;r^2 + &#960;r^2
<span style="background-color:blue; color:red;">
T.S.A. of a hemisphere = 3&#960;r^2 sq.units </span>


---




### Hollow Hemisphere

Let the inner radius be r and outer radius be R, 
 then thickness = R−r 
![Figure with 50%](fig7.16.png "w-50 float-end")
Therefore, C.S.A. = Area of external hemisphere 
 + Area of internal hemisphere
 = 2&#960;R^2 + 2&#960;r^2
<span style="background-color:blue; color:red;">
C.S.A. of a hollow hemisphere = 2&#960;(R^2 + r^2) sq. units </span>
![Figure with 50%](fig7.17.png "w-50 float-end")
 T.S.A. = C.S.A. + Area of annulus region
 = 2&#960;(R^2 + r^2) + &#960;(R^2 - r^2)
 = &#960;[2R^2 +2r^2 + R^2 - r^2]

<span style="background-color:blue; color:red;">
T.S.A. of a hollow hemisphere = &#960;(3R^2+r^2) sq. units </span>


**Example 7.8**   Find the diameter of a sphere whose surface area is 154 m2.

<!-- **Solution**   Let r be the radius of the sphere. <img src="fig7.18.png" alt="activity" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.18.png "w-50 float-end")
Given that, surface area of sphere = 154 m2

 4&#960;r^2 = 154
 4x 22/7xr^2 = 154

 ⇒ r2 = 154 × 1 / 4 x 7/22

 r2 = 49 /4  we get r = 7/2

 Therefore, diameter is 7 m




**Example 7.9**  The radius of a spherical balloon increases from 12 cm to 16 cm as air 
being pumped into it. Find the ratio of the surface area of the balloons in the two cases.

**Solution**  Let r
1 and r2 be the radii of the balloons. 
 Given that, r1/r2 = 12/16=3/4

 Now, ratio of C.S.A. of balloons = 
 4&#960;r1^2/ 4&#960;r2^2 = r1^2 / r2^2 = (r1/r2)^2 = (3/4)^2 
= 9/16

Therefore, ratio of C.S.A. of balloons is 9:16.

**Progress Check**

1. Every section of a sphere by a plane is a ____________.
2. The centre of a great circle is at the ____________ of the sphere.
3. The difference between the T.S.A. and C.S.A. of hemisphere is ______.
4. The ratio of surface area of a sphere and C.S.A. of hemisphere is _________.
5. A section of the sphere by a plane through any of its great circle is ________.


**Example 7.10**  If the base area of a hemispherical solid is 1386 sq. metres, then find its 
total surface area?

**Solution**  Let r be the radius of the hemisphere.

 Given that, base area = &#960;r^2 = 1386 sq. m

<div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 10px;margin-right:10px;">
NOTE :

 For finding the C.S.A. 
and T.S.A. of a hollow 
sphere, the formulla for 
finding the surface area 
of a sphere can be used.
</div>


 T.S.A. = 3&#960;r^2 sq.m

 = 3 x 1386 = 4158

Therefore, T.S.A. of the hemispherical solid is 4158 m2.


**Thinking Corner**

1. Shall we get a hemisphere when a sphere is cut along the small circle?
2. T.S.A of a hemisphere is equal to how many times the area of its base? 
3. How many hemispheres can be obtained from a given sphere?


**Example 7.11**   The internal and external radii of a hollow hemispherical shell are 3 m and 
5 m respectively. Find the T.S.A. and C.S.A. of the shell.
 <!-- <img src="fig7.19.png" alt="semicircle" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
 ![Figure with 50%](fig7.19.png "w-50 float-end")
**Solution**   Let the internal and external radii of the hemispherical shell be r and R
respectively.

 Given that, R = 5 m, r =3 m

 C.S.A. of the shell = 2&#960;(R^2 + r^2) sq. units
 = 2 x 22/7 x (25+ 9) = 213.71

 T.S.A. of the shell = &#960;(3R^2 + r^2) sq. units
 =  22/7(75+9) = 264

Therefore, C.S.A.= 213.71 m
2 and T.S.A. = 264 m2.



<!-- **Example 7.12**   A sphere, a cylinder <img src="fig7.20.png" alt="shapes" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->
![Figure with 50%](fig7.20.png "w-50 float-end")
and a cone are of the same height 
which is equal to its radius, where as 
cone and cylinder are of same height. 
Find the ratio of their curved surface 
areas


---


**Solution**   Required Ratio = C.S.A. of the sphere: C.S.A. of the cylinder : C.S.A. of the cone
 = 4&#960;r^2 : 2&#960;rh : &#960;rl     (l=((r^2+h^2)^(1/2)= (2r^2)/(1/2)) = 2r^(1/2) )

 = 4&#960;r^2 : 2&#960;r^2 : &#960;r(1/2)^2 r

 = 4&#960;r^2 : 2&#960;r^2 : 2^(1/2)&#960;r^2
 
 = 4: 2: 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/2)2: 2^(1/2) :1



 ### Frustum of a right circular cone

<!-- In olden days a cone shaped buckets <img src="fig7.21.png" alt="fire" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" /> -->![Figure with 50%](fig7.21.png "w-50 float-end")

to extinguish fire during fire accidents. Later, 
it was reshaped to a round shaped bottom 
[Fig.7.21(b)] to increase its volume. 
The shape in [Fig.7.21(c)] resembling a ![Figure with 50%](fig7.22.png "w-50 float-end")
inverted bucket is called as a frustrum of a cone. 
The objects which we use in our daily life 
such as glass, bucket, street cone are examples of

<span style="color:red;"> Definition </span>

When a cone ABC is cut through by a plane parallel to its 
base, the portion of the cone DECB between the cutting plane 
and the base is called a frustum of the cone.
</div>


**Surface area of a frustum**

Let R and r be radii of the base and top region of the frustum DECB respectively, h
is the height and l is the slant height of the same.

Therefore, C.S.A. = 1/2
 (sum of the perimeters of base and top region) × slant height
 =1/2(2&#960;R + 2&#960;r) l

C.S.A. of a frustum= &#960;(R +r)l sq. units      where, l= (h^2 + (R-r)^2)^1/2

 T.S.A. = C.S.A. + Area of the bottom circular region 
 + Area of the top circular region.

T.S.A. of a frustum= &#960;(R+r)l + &#960;R^2 + &#960;r^2 sq. units
  
  where, l= (h^2 + (R-r)^2)^1/2

  **Example 7.13**   The slant height of a frustum of a cone is 5 cm and the radii of its ends are 
4 cm and 1 cm. Find its curved surface area.

**Solution**   Let l, R and r be the slant height, top radius and bottom radius of the frustum.

 Given that, l=5 cm, R =4 cm, r =1 cm


Now, C.S.A. of the frustum = &#960;(R+r)l sq. units

 = 22/7 x (4+1) x 5

 = 550/7

 Therefore, C.S.A. = 78.57 cm2

**Example 7.14**   An industrial metallic bucket is in the shape of the frustum of a right 
circular cone whose top and bottom diameters are 10 m and 4 m and whose height is 4 m. 
Find the curved and total surface area of the bucket.

**Solution**   Let h, l, R and r be the height, slant height, top radius and bottom radius of the 
frustum.

Given that, diameter of the top =10 m; radius of the top R = 5 m. 
diameter of the bottom = 4 m; radius of the bottom r = 2 m, height h= 4 m


![Figure with 50%](fig7.24.png "w-50 float-end")
 Now, l =  (h^2+ (R −r)^2)^1/2

 = (4^2 + (5 -2)^2)^ 1/2

 l = (16+ 9)^1/2 = 25 =5m

 C.S.A. = &#960;(R+r)l sq. units

 = 22/7 (5+2)x5 
 = 110 m2

 T.S.A. = &#960;(R+r)l + &#960;R^2 + &#960;r^2 sq. units
 =22/7[(5+2)5+25+4] = 1408/7
= 201.14

 Therefore, C.S.A. = 110 m2 and T.S.A. = 201.14 m2

## Volume

Having discussed about the surface areas of cylinder, cone, sphere, 
hemisphere and frustum, we shall now discuss about the volumes of 
these solids.

Volume refers to the amount of space occupied by an object.
The volume is measured in cubic units.


### Volume of a solid right circular cylinder


The volume of a right circular cylinder of base radius ‘r’ and height ‘h’ 
is given by V = (Base Area) × (Height) =&#960;r^2 x h  = &#960;r^2h cubic units.


Therefore, Volume of a cylinder = &#960;r^2h cu. units


---

### 7.3.2 Volume of a hollow cylinder (volume of the material used)

Let the internal and external radii of a hollow cylinder be r and R
units respectively. If the height of the cylinder is h units then
 ![Figure with 50%](fig7.26.png "w-50 float-end")
The volume V =( volume of the 
outer cylinder) - (
volume of the 
inner cylinder)
 
 V = &#960;R^2h - &#960;r^2h = &#960;(R^2 - r^2)h

Volume of a hollow cylinder =&#960;(R^2 - r^2)h  cu. units.


**Example 7.15**   Find the volume of a cylinder whose height is 2 m and whose base area 
is 250 m2.

**Solution**   Let r and h be the radius and height of the cylinder respectively.

 Given that, height h = 2 m, base area = 250 m2 

Now, volume of a cylinder = &#960;r^2h cu. units
 =  base area x h
 =  250 x 2 = 500 m3 

Therefore, volume of the cylinder = 500 m3 



**Thinking Corner**

1. If the height is inversely proportional to the square of its radius, the volume of the 
cylinder is ____________.
2. What happens to the volume of the cylinder with radius r and height h, when its 
(a) radius is halved (b) height is halved.



**Example 7.16**   The volume of a cylindrical water tank is 1.078 × 106 litres. If the diameter 
of the tank is 7 m, find its height.

**Solution**   Let r and h be the radius and height of the cylinder respectively.

Given that, volume of the tank = 1.078 x 10^6 = 1078000 litre
 = 1078 m3 ( 1l = 1/1000 m3)

 diameter = 7m  => radius = 7/2 m

 volume of the tank = &#960;r^2h cu. units
 1078 = 22/7 x 7/2 x 7/2 x h


Therefore, height of the tank is 28 m


---

**Example 7.17**   Find the volume of the iron used to make a hollow cylinder of height 9 cm 
and whose internal and external radii are 21 cm and 28 cm respectively.

**Solution**   Let r, R and h be the internal radius, external radius and height of the hollow 
cylinder respectively.

Given that, r =21cm, R = 28 cm, h = 9 cm

 Now, volume of hollow cylinder = &#960;(R^2 - r^2)h cu. units

 = 22/7 (28^2 - 21 ^2) x 9

 = 22/7 (784 - 441) x 9
  = 9702

Therefore, volume of iron used = 9702 cm3



**Example 7.18**   For the cylinders A and B (Fig. 7.27), 
(i) find out the cylinder whose volume is greater.
(ii) verify whether the cylinder with greater volume has greater total surface area.
(iii) find the ratios of the volumes of the cylinders A and B.

**Solution** 

(i) Volume of cylinder = &#960;r^2h cu. units

Volume of cylinder A= 22/7 x 7/2 x 7/2 x 21

 = 808.5 cm3

Volume of cylinder B= 22/7 x 21/2 x 21/2 x 7

= 2425.5 cm3

Therefore, volume of cylinder B is greater 
than volume of cylinder A.


(ii) T.S.A. of cylinder = 2&#960;r(h + r) sq. units

 T.S.A. of cylinder A = 2 x 22/7 x 7/2 x (21 + 3.5)= 539 cm2

 T.S.A. of cylinder B = 2 x 22/7 x 21/2 x (7 + 10.5) = 1155 cm2

Hence verified that cylinder B with greater volume has a greater surface area.


(iii) Volume of cylinder A /
Volume of cylinder
 = 808.5 / 2425.5 = 1/3


Therefore, ratio of the volumes of cylinders A and B is 1:3.

### 7.3.3 Volume of a right circular cone


Let r and h be the radius and height of a cone then its volume 
 V  = 1/3 &#960;r^2h cu. units.

 <!-- <img src="fig7.28.png" alt="demonstration" style=" margin-right:10px;" /> -->
 ![Figure with 50%](fig7.28.png "w-50 float-end")


 From, Fig.7.28 we see that,
 3× (Volume of a cone) = Volume of cylinder
 = &#960;r^2h  cu. units

Volume of a cone = 1/3&#960;r^2h cu. units



**Example 7.19**  The volume of a solid right circular cone is 11088 cm3. If its height is 24 cm 
then find the radius of the cone.

**Solution**   Let r and h be the radius and height of the cone respectively.

 Given that, volume of the cone =11088 cm3 

1/3&#960;r^2h = 11088
1/3 x 22/7 x r^2 x 24 = 11088

r^2 = 441

Therefore, radius of the cone r = 21 cm

(a) height and slant height (b) radius and slant height (c) height and radius.
2. There are two cones with equal volumes. What will be the ratio of their radius and 
height?


---


**Example 7.20**  
The ratio of the volumes of two cones is 2:3. Find the ratio of their radii if 
the height of second cone is double the height of the first.

**Solution**   Let r
1 and h1 be the radius and height of the cone-I and let r2 and h2 be the 
radius and height of the cone-II.

Given that, h2 = 2h1  and 
(Volume of the cone I) / (Volume of the cone II)
= 2/3
1/3 &#960;r1^2h1 / 1/3 &#960; r2^2h2 = 2/3

 ⇒ r1^2 / r2^2 x h1 / 2h1 = 2/3

r1^2 / r2^2 = 4 / 3 ⇒ r1 / r2 = 2/ 3^(1/2)


 Therefore, ratio of their radii = 2 : 3^(1/2)

### 7.3.4 Volume of sphere 


Let r be the radius of a sphere then its volume is given by V  = 4/3&#960;r^3 cu. units.
 
 <img src="fig7.30.png" alt="demonstration 7.30" style="margin-right:10px;" />



 ---

 From the Fig.7.30, we see that 
 Volume of a sphere = 2 × (Volume of a cone)
where the diameters of sphere and cone are equal 
to the height of the cone.
 =2 (1/3&#960;r^2h)

 = 2/3&#960;r^2(2r),
( h  = 2 r)

 Volume of a sphere = 4/3&#960;r^3 cu. units


### 7.3.5 Volume of a hollow sphere / spherical shell (volume of the material used)
<img src="fig7.31.png" alt="fig" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" />

Let r and R be the inner and outer radius of the hollow sphere.

Volume enclosed between the outer and inner spheres
 = 4/3&#960;R^3 - 4/3&#960;r^3


Volume of a hollow sphere =  4/3&#960;(R^3 - r^3) cu. units


### 7.3.6 Volume of solid hemisphere
<img src="fig7.32.png" alt="fig" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" />


Let r be the radius of the solid hemisphere.

Volume of the solid hemisphere = 1/2 (volume of sphere)
 = 1/2(4/3&#960;r^3)

Volume of a solid hemisphere = 2/3 &#960;r^3  cu. units


### 7.3.7 Volume of hollow hemisphere (volume of the material used)
 
 <img src="fig7.33.png" alt="fig" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" />

Let r and R be the inner and outer radius of the hollow hemisphere.

 Volume of hollow
hemisphere = (Volume of outer
hemisphere) −(Volume of inner
hemisphere)

 = 2/3 &#960;R^3 - 2/3 &#960;r^3

Volume of a hollow hemisphere = 2/3 &#960;(R^3 -r^3) cu. units


**Thinking Corner**

A cone, a hemisphere and a cylinder have equal bases. The heights of the cone and 
cylinder are equal and are same as the common radius. Are they equal in volume?




---


**Example 7.21**  The volume of a solid hemisphere is 29106 cm3. Another hemisphere whose 
volume is two-third of the above is carved out. Find the radius of the new hemisphere.

**Solution**   Let r be the radius of the hemisphere.

Given that, volume of the hemisphere = 29106 cm3 

 Now, volume of new hemisphere = 2/3
(Volume of original sphere)

 = 2/3 x 29106

 Volume of new hemisphere = 19404 cm3 

 2/3&#960;r^3 = 19404

 r3 = (19404 x 3 x 7) / (2 x 22)
 = 9261

 r = 9261^(1/3) = 21 cm

Therefore, r = 21 cm

2. A plane along a great circle will split the sphere into _____ parts.
3. If the volume and surface area of a sphere are numerically equal, then the radius

**Example 7.22**   Calculate the mass of a hollow brass sphere if the inner diameter is 14 cm 
and thickness is 1mm, and whose density is 17.3 g/ cm3. (Hint: mass = density × volume)


**Solution**   Let r and R be the inner and outer radii of the hollow sphere.

Given that, inner diameter d =14 cm; inner radius r = 7 cm; thickness = 1 mm = 1/10cm

 Outer radius R = 7+1/10 = = 71/10 = 7.1 cm

 Volume of hollow sphere = 4/3&#960;(R^3 - r^3) cu. units
 = 4/3 x 22/7(357.91 - 343 )
  = 62.48 cm3 

But, density of brass in 1 cm3 = 17.3 gm

Total mass = 17.3 x 62.48 = 1080.90 gm

 Therefore, total mass is 1080.90 grams.

### 7.3.8 Volume of frustum of a cone
<img src="fig7.34.png" alt="7.34" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" />

Let H and h be the height of cone and frustum respectively, 
L and l be the slant height of the same.

If R, r are the radii of the circular bases of the frustum, 
then volume of the frustum of the cone is the difference of the 
volumes of the two cones. 

 V  = 1/3&#960;R^2H - 1/3&#960;(H-h)

Since the triangles ABC and ADE are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides 
are proportional.

Therefore, H-h / H = ⇒
r / R ⇒ H = hR /R-r …(1)
<img src="thinking.png" alt="thinking" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" />
 V = 1/3&#960;R^2H - 1/3&#960;(H-h)
 =&#960;H(R^2 - r^2) + 1/3&#960;r^2h
 =&#960;/3 hR/ R-r (R^2 - r^2) + &#960;r^2h    [using (1)]
 =&#960;/3hR(R+r)+&#960;/3r^2h
 

Volume of a frustum = &#960;h/3(R^2+Rr+r^2) cu. units


**Example 7.23** If the radii of the circular ends of a frustum which is 45 cm high are 28 cm 
and 7 cm, find the volume of the frustum.
<img src="fig7.35.png" alt="7.35" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" />
**Solution**  Let h, r and R be the height, top and bottom radii of the frustum.

Given that, h = 45 cm, R = 28 cm, r = 7 cm

Volume = &#960;1/3(R^2+Rr+r^2)h cu. units
 = 1/3 x 22/7 x [28^2 + (28 x 7)+ 7^2] x 45

=1/3 x 22/7 x 1029 x 45 = 48510

Therefore, volume of the frustum is 48510 cm3

## 7.4 Volume and Surface Area of Combined Solids


Observe the shapes given (Fig.7.37).

The shapes provided lead to the following definitions of ‘Combined Solid’.


---

A combined solid is said to be a solid <img src="fig7.37.png" alt="omar" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" />
formed by combining two or more solids.
The concept of combined solids is 
useful in the fields like doll making, building 
construction, carpentry, etc.

To calculate the surface area of the 
combined solid, we should only calculate the 
areas that are visible to our eyes. For example, if 
a cone is surmounted by a hemisphere, we need 
to just find out the C.S.A. of the hemisphere and C.S.A. of the cone separately and add 
them together. Note that we are leaving the base area of both the cone and the hemisphere 
since both the bases are attached together and are not visible.
But, the volume of the solid formed by joining two basic solids will be the sum of the 
volumes of the individual solids.


**Example 7.24**  A toy is in the shape of a cylinder surmounted by a <img src="fig7.38.png" alt="7.38" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" />
hemisphere. The height of the toy is 25 cm. Find the total surface 
area of the toy if its common diameter is 12 cm.

**Solution**   Let r and h be the radius and height of the cylinder 
respectively.

 Given that, diameter d = 12 cm, radius r = 6 cm

Total height of the toy is 25 cm

Therefore, height of the cylindrical portion = − 25 6 = 19 cm

 T.S.A. of the toy =C.S.A. of the cylinder + C.S.A. of the hemisphere
 +Base Area of the cylinder

 = 2&#960;rh + 2&#960;r^2 + &#960;r^2

 = &#960;rh (2h+ 3r) sq.units

 = 22/7 x 6 x (38 + 18)
 
 =22/7 x 6 x 56 = 1056

Therefore, T.S.A. of the toy is 1056 cm2


**Example 7.25**  A jewel box (Fig. 7.39) is in the shape of a cuboid of <img src="fig7.39.png" alt="fig" style="float:right; margin-right:10px;" />
dimensions 30 cm x 15 cm x 10 cm surmounted by a half part of 
a cylinder as shown in the figure. Find the volume of the box.


**Solution**  Let l, b and h1 be the length, breadth and height of the 
cuboid. Also let us take r and h2 be the radius and height of the 
cylinder.
