**Srinivasa Ramanujan** was an Indian mathematical genius who was born in Erode in a poor family. He was a child prodigy and made calculations at lightning speed. He produced thousands of precious formulae, jotting them on his three notebooks which are now preserved at the University of Madras. With the help of several notable men, he became the first research scholar in the mathematics department of University of Madras. Subsequently, he went to England and collaborated with G.H. Hardy for five years from 1914 to 1919 .

He possessed great interest in observing the pattern of numbers and produced
several new results in Analytic Number Theory. His mathematical ability was compared
to Euler and Jacobi, the two great mathematicians of the past Era. Ramanujan wrote
thirty important research papers and wrote seven research papers in coll

aboration with G.H. Hardy. He has produced 3972 formulas and theorems in very short span of 32 years lifetime. He was awarded B.A. degree for research in 1916 by Cambridge University which is equivalent to modern day Ph.D. Degree. For his contributions to number theory, he was made Fellow of Royal Society (F.R.S.) in 1918.

His works continue to delight mathematicians worldwide even today. Many
surprising connections are made in the last few years of work made by Ramanujan nearly a century ago.

# Introduction 

![](introduction.png)

The study of numbers has fascinated humans
since several thousands of years. The discovery of
Lebombo and Ishango bones which existed around
25000 years ago has confirmed the fact that humans
made counting process for meeting various day to
day needs. By making notches in the bones they
carried out counting efficiently. Most consider
that these bones were used as lunar calendar for
knowing the phases of moon thereby understanding
the seasons. Thus the bones were considered to be
the ancient tools for counting. We have come a long
way since this primitive counting method existed.

It is very true that the patterns exhibited by numbers have fascinated almost all
professional mathematicians’ right from the time of Pythagoras to current time. We will be
discussing significant concepts provided by Euclid and continue our journey of studying
Modular Arithmetic and knowing about Sequences and Finite Series. These ideas are
most fundamental to your progress in mathematics for upcoming classes. It is time for us
to begin our journey to understand the most fascinating part of mathematics, namely, the
study of numbers.
